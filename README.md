# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains two projects focusing on exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation using machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. MNIST Data Exploration

#### Description:
This project revolves around exploring the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images. The main tasks performed in this project include data preprocessing, clustering, regression, and model evaluation.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
- Clustering: Employing clustering algorithms to identify patterns and group similar handwritten digits together.
- Regression: Utilizing regression techniques to predict numeric values associated with the handwritten digits.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. Stack Overflow Survey Data 2020 Exploration and Salary Prediction App

#### Description:
This project focuses on exploring the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data from 2020 and developing an application to predict salaries based on various factors.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Exploration: Analyzing the Stack Overflow survey data to understand the demographics, job roles, and salary distributions.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for modeling.
- Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict salaries using features such as programming languages, years of experience, education level, etc.
- Application Development: Creating an interactive web or desktop application where users can input their details and receive salary predictions based on the trained models.
