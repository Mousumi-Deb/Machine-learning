# MNIST Dataset Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project utilizes the MNIST dataset to perform machine learning tasks, including clustering and regression. The MNIST dataset consists of a large number of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Libraries Used
The project makes use of the following libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploration.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations and plots.

## Tasks Performed
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Scaling**: The data is scaled using Min-Max and Standard scalers to normalize the feature values.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for feature reduction.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar digits together.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes.

### 3. Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Simple regression model to predict numerical values.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**: Algorithm for predicting values based on the nearest data points.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Ensemble learning method for regression tasks.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Various evaluation metrics are used such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared, and Cross-Validation scores.
- **Visualizations**: Visual representations of the results, including scatter plots, regression plots, and error distributions.
